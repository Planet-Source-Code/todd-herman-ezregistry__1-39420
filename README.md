## EZRegistry


</div>

### Description

This is THE registry class (compiled as ActiveX DLL)! I worked VERY hard in researching and streamlining this code. It is much more in depth then any other registry module or class i've been able to find. It supports all the major data types and includes the ability to connect to a remote registry as well as load and unload registry hives!!

If there any problems with the code (or included help file) please let me know. I want to perfect this as much as possible. Also, keep in mind I am finishing up sample code for VBScript ans VB as well as a more detailed CHM help file. Those should be forthcoming by the end of the week.

Feel free to email me if you guys have any issues or problems. I developed the code under Windows NT but performed some testing under Windows ME. Most of the functions should still work under Windows 95/98 but not all data types are supported.
 
### More Info
 
This class assumes a basic understanding of the windows registry.

Severe registry damage if the code is not used properly.
